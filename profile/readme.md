# EMERSE

Though the EMERSE project is open-source, the projects here are private since we want to track the usage of it since it is grant-funded.  If you want accesss, send the EMERSE team a message at EMERSE-team@umich.edu.  The links below will only work if you are logged into GitHub and given permission to view the specific project, otherwise GitHub will report the pages as not able to be found.

Here's a short list of the projects you can ask us about:

* [EMERSE](https://github.com/project-emerse/emerse) is our full text medical record search engine.
* [Indexing](https://github.com/project-emerse/indexing) is our tool for indexing documents into Solr for use in EMERSE.
* [HL7 Processor](https://github.com/project-emerse/hl7-processor) is our hl7 message processor and rtf-to-html/pdf document converter.
* [Schedule](https://github.com/project-emerse/schedule) is our simple cron-like application for doing ETL tasks.

And here are some of the libraries we developed, used in some or all of the projects, which you can also get access to:

* [Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/project-emerse/gradle-plugin) is a gradle plugin used in many projects and structures projects similarly.
* [SQL](https://github.com/project-emerse/sql) is a slim layer of JDBC which abstracts SQL just enough to be database vendor agnostic.

These libraries are stored on our own [maven repository](https://project-emerse.org/repo/), referenced in some of our projects.
